Hi internet.
I am KÃ©vin Maschtaler, a french web developer since a few years but I started to fiddle with computers at twelve years old.

Now at <acronym title="We are recruiting!">[marmelab](http://www.marmelab.com), a nice Digital Innovation Workshop</acronym> where I learn a lot of stuff and make things done on innovative projects with very modern technologies. I mostly write JavaScript for work or open-source, Python for fun or side-projects and my interest goes to various topics such as sysadmin (a lot), security, crypto-currencies, etc.

Fullstack developer, DevOps, internet's builder, something between or all at once. I wear multiple hats, even freelancer. I like to rub shoulders with startupers in order to learn new methods or just listen stories.

Finally, I am used to document my discoveries or talks on my blog (soon) or more frequently on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Kmaschta). If you are curious about what I do you should take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/Kmaschta) page. And if by chance you are not far from Nancy or Paris, feel free to ping me, I would love to share a drink!
